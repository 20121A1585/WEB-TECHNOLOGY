           <p><h2><b style="font-size: 20px;">Story Line:</b></h2>Inspired by a film character, Venkataratnam, a policeman, calls himself Gabbar Singh. He is posted in a village where a local thug wants to join politics and also lures his stepbrother to join him.<br>
           
           <p><h2><b style="font-size: 20px;">Highlights:</b></h2>Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit Gabbar Singh Gujjar who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears, and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen.</p>
           <p><h2><b style="font-size: 20px;">Drawbacks:</b></h2>The negative points are hurried climax and inadequate screenplay in the second half. The hero is more powerful than villain, hence the hero vs villain thread is weak</p>
